"I've built a full stack project using the MERN stack that processes Excel files to extract unique candidates and store them in MongoDB. The frontend is developed with React.js, while the backend uses Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Multer.

To start the application:
For Frontend: (excelupload)

Run npm install
Run npm start

For Backend:(exceltomongo)

Run npm install
Run npm start
For the database, update the MongoDB connection string in the server.js file as needed."
